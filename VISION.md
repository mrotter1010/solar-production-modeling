# Vision

## Product Vision

Build a lean, deterministic system that produces **bankable solar production outputs** using NREL SAM, starting from a standardized CSV configuration and ending with **customer-ready data, visuals, and summary reporting**.

The system prioritizes:
- Correctness over convenience
- Transparency of assumptions
- Reproducibility
- Minimal operational complexity

The MVP focuses **only on solar production modeling**. Storage, dispatch, and financial optimization are explicitly out of scope.

## Target User

Internal energy analytics workflows that require:
- Rapid, repeatable PV production estimates
- Climate-driven loss modeling
- Clean artifacts suitable for customer delivery

---

## Success Definition

Given a CSV of site configurations, the system reliably produces:
- A complete SAM-backed 8760 production profile per site
- Interpretable loss attribution
- Simple, professional outputs ready for customer consumption
